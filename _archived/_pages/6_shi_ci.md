## Shi-Ci (诗词)

诗词, or more broadly, 诗词歌赋, are traditional Chinese literature that include poems, verses, ditties, odes, and much more. They carry distinct features of their time and some of them are performed at informal or formal gatherings (although unfortunately their accompanying music scores have been lost with time).

They are a glowing part of the Chinese history that I like and admire. I learned pieces of them in classroom as I grew up, but more because it was (and still is) mandatory. Then a young and inspiring teacher in my high school showed their beauty in his class and I began to appreciate them from another lens.

However, as I drift farther and farther away in time and in location, I can no longer recite many of even my favorite ones, and I often struggle to write or speak proper Chinese. I know this would happen, but witnessing the happening is deeply disturbing nonetheless - like witnessing a degenerative disease deteriorating, a train going off the cliff with your fondest memories and a bulk part of your identity.

I do not expect I can reverse the trend, but I hope I can at least slow it down. This page has an API ([今日诗词](https://www.jinrishici.com)) that will return a verse each time you refresh. The developer also made beautiful [calendar](https://shici.store/poetry-calendar) and other apps that are along this theme (pictures on this page are from the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/chinese-poetry/poetry-calendar)).
