My research seeks to advance the sustainability of engineered systems through experimentation and quantitative sustainable design (QSD) â€“ a systematic approach that integrates concepts associated with sustainability science and engineering. Specifically, I am interested in (i) developing technologies and systems for renewable products from wastes and biomass, and (ii) leveraging the QSD methodology for the research, development, and deployment (RD&D) of technologies and inform decision-making.

### Doctoral Research

Toward experimentation, my doctoral research focused on resource recovery from wastewater through biomass (e.g., algae, bacteria for biopolymers). Wastewater-derived biomass can transform contaminants and/or excess nutrients in wastewater into their storage compounds (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates), and I applied multiple technologies (e.g., hydrothermal reactions that happen in hot, compressed water) to convert them into biofuels, fertilizers, and platform chemicals.
