## Teaching

### Course Instructed

#### Environmnetal Engineering Principles, Chemical (UIUC)

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the fundamental principles that govern chemical and biochemical processes in natural and engineered environmental systems, and to employ quantitative approaches to solving aquatic chemistry problems. 

Key course topics include the thermodynamic and kinetic basis for the composition of aquatic systems, chemical equilibrium, acid-base chemistry, aqueous/gas partitioning, alkalinity and pH buffering, metal speciation and precipitation, redox reactions, and sorption processes. Analytical and numerical approaches to solving chemical problems will be illustrated using topics of interest to environmental engineers and scientists.

### Future Course

#### Quantitative Sustainable Design for Engineered Systems

With my interests, experiences, and skills, I would be excited to develop a new course titled Quantitative Sustainable Design (QSD) of Engineered Systems to (i) introduce the concept and method of sustainability design in the context of engineering system design, and (ii) leverage the QSD methodology and the open-source tools in my research for case studies and group projects to engage students with practical applications.

## Mentoring

I am actively engaged in mentoring throughout my doctoral and postdoctoral experiences (ten undergraduate and graduate students), which has led to multiple published papers and manuscripts in revision/preparation, and work from an REU student had contributed to a National Science Foundation grant application that was successfully funded.

I have also participated the [Clean Water Science Network](https://www.cleanwaterscience.org) (CWSN) program which provides mentorship for Latin American undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing graduate studies in water-related degrees in the United States, as well as the [Research Internship in Sustainable Bioenergy](https://cabbi.bio/news/outreach/) (RISE) program to provide research and career development opportunities to students from groups currently underrepresented in STEM fields.
