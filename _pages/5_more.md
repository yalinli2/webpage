## Education and outreach activities

I have organized and participated in many education and outreach activities, including summer camps and school science nights/fairs.

For example, I was one of the organizers and instructors for the Girls’ Adventures in Mathematics, Engineering, and Sciences (G.A.M.E.S) camp at UIUC, where I developed the learning program (course materials and experiment sessions) and instructed the “Renewable Energy-Biofuels” session.

I represented ReNUWIt in the Orange County Children’s Water Education Festival, where I co-organized and presented the City Stormwater Design Challenge Program. This two-day festival attracted more than 122,000 children in total, and 300-400 children participated in the ReNUWIt program.

## Other things I enjoy

As a self-trained programmer, the more I learn about coding, the more powerful I find it to be. Just like research, learning and mastering a new language can be extremely frustrating, but it brings a great sense of achievement when you manage to struggle through the barrieres and make it (e.g., when I see this website live online).

I also enjoy the nature and especially like hiking, as you can tell from the cover pictures on each page and the collage below, they were mostly taken when I was doing my Ph.D. in Colorado, purely breath-taking.
