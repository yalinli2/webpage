<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>My research seeks to advance the sustainability of engineered systems through experimentation and quantitative sustainable design (QSD) – a systematic approach that integrates concepts associated with sustainability science and engineering. Specifically, I am interested in (i) developing technologies and systems for renewable products from wastes and biomass, and (ii) leveraging the QSD methodology for the research, development, and deployment (RD&amp;D) of technologies and inform decision-making.</p>

<h3 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h3>

<p>Toward experimentation, my doctoral research focused on resource recovery from wastewater through biomass (e.g., algae, bacteria for biopolymers). Wastewater-derived biomass can transform contaminants and/or excess nutrients in wastewater into their storage compounds (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates), and I applied multiple technologies (e.g., hydrothermal reactions that happen in hot, compressed water) to convert them into biofuels, fertilizers, and platform chemicals.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="quantitative-sustainable-design-qsd">Quantitative Sustainable Design (QSD)</h3>

<p>With the experimental foundation, I am currently leveraging the QSD methodology to guide the RD&amp;D of technologies and inform decision-making. QSD provides a transparent and agile approach to characterize the sustainability of systems using techniques (e.g., techno-economic analysis, TEA; life cycle assessment, LCA) and indicators (e.g., internal rate of return, global warming potential) covering economic, environmental, health, and social dimensions.</p>

<p>To enable the execution of QSD and inform decision-making, I am leading and contributing to the development of multiple open-source tools (see the section below for more details) for system design, simulation, as well as sustainability characterization (e.g., through TEA and LCA).</p>

<p>With these tools, I am leading the design of spatiotemporally resolved sustainable sanitation systems (resource recovery from excreta) and biorefineries (new bioproducts, high-rate, small-footprint wastewater treatment and energy recovery processes). Further, the wide applicability of the QSD methodology allows me to collaborate with researchers from multiple disciplines (e.g., agronomics, ecosystem, genomics, chemical and metabolic engineering) and characterize the sustainability of interdisciplinary systems, identify gaps and bottlenecks, prioritize research directions, and set explicit targets.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I am the <strong><em>creator &amp; lead developer</em></strong> for the QSDsan platform, which is built around the core package QSDsan (<a href="https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan">source code</a>, <a href="https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest">documentation</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-tj_uM0mIdFv72MAULnWjS6lx_cCyi2N">video demo</a>). QSDsan is an open-source tool in Python that integrates system design, simulation, TEA, and LCA under uncertainty. Sanitation systems developed using QSDsan are deposited in the <a href="https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan">EXPOsan</a> (exposition) repository, and another package, <a href="https://github.com/qsD-Group/DMsan">DMsan</a> (decision-making), is leveraged to navigate decision-making among multiple dimensions of sustainability using sustainability indicators simulated in QSDsan with location-specific contextual parameters. Efforts are also underway to develop interactive education modules using the QSDsan platform.</p>

<p>QSDsan is also being leveraged in the development of other open-source tools for water and wastewater treatment, including <a href="https://watertap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">WaterTAP</a> (Water Techno-economic Assessment Platform) funded by the National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI), the Department of Energy’s Energy-Water Desalination Hub, to advance early-stage water treatment technologies and enable the treatment of non-traditional water sources.</p>

<p>I am also a <strong><em>core developer</em></strong> of the BioSTEAM (<a href="https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam">source code</a>, <a href="https://biosteam.readthedocs.io">documentation</a>), which is an open-source tool in Python for system design, simulation, and TEA for biorefineries under uncertainty. It has been used in multiple studies to assess the sustainability of novel feedstocks and emerging bioproducts.</p>

<h4 id="sanitation-and-resource-recovery-systems">Sanitation and Resource Recovery Systems</h4>

<p>With the QSDsan platform, I am exploring the sustainability of resource recovery-based systems to increase the safeness and access to sanitation service considering (i) different location-specific contextual parameters, as well as (ii) stakeholder priorities through multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="sustainable-biorefineries">Sustainable Biorefineries</h4>

<p>To prioritize the research needs for innovative biofuels and bioproducts, I am investigating the economic viability and environmental impacts of novel feedstocks (e.g., oilcane, metabolically engineered sugarcane with elevated triacylglycerol contents) and emerging bioproducts (e.g., <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08055">lactic acid</a>, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, triacetic acid lactone) across a wide technological landscape with the BioSTEAM platform.</p>

<p>Moreover, with my background in resource recovery, I am renovating the wastewater treatment process in biorefineries with high-rate technologies (e.g., anaerobic membrane bioreactor, AnMBR) to lower the footprint and enhance the plant energy recovery for more sustainable biorefineries.</p>

<h4 id="biobased-value-chain">Biobased Value Chain</h4>

<p>This project aims to establish an automated data-processing and information hand-off framework to connect the different modeling platforms (e.g., the ecosystem model <a href="https://www2.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/daycent/">DayCent</a>) across the biobased value chain, thus enabling high-resolution (i.e., contextually resolved and sensitive to technological advancements) economic and environmental sustainability analysis of bioenergy and bioproducts through TEA and LCA.</p>
