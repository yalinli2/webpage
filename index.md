Welcome to my site!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Guest Group](http://engineeringforsustainability.com) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](http://illinois.edu). I am affiliated with the [Institute of Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE)](https://sustainability.illinois.edu) and the [Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproduct Innovation (CABBI)](https://cabbi.bio) at UIUC. I got my Bachelor degree from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn), my Master from UIUC, and my Doctorate from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu) (with [Prof. Strathmann](https://strathmanngroup.com)).

You can read more about my [research](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/research), check out my [publications](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/publications) and conference [presentations](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/presentations), my experiences in [teaching and mentoring](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/teaching_and_mentoring) (and the education modules I'm developing for quantitative sustainable design (QSD) using the open-source tool developed in my research), as well as some [other activities](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/more) (including how this site is built).
