Welcome to my website!

I am currently a Research Scientist at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu). I am affiliated with the [Institute of Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE)](https://sustainability.illinois.edu) and the [Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI)](https://cabbi.bio) at UIUC. I got my Bachelor's degree from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn), my Master's from UIUC, and my Doctorate from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu).

You can read more about my [research](/research/), check out my [publications](/publications/) and conference [presentations](/presentations/), my experiences in [teaching and mentoring](/teaching_and_mentoring/) (and the education modules I'm developing for quantitative sustainable design (QSD) using the open-source tool developed in my research), as well as some [other activities](/more/).


My contacts and links to various profiles can be found at the bottom of each page, feel free to reach out and get to know me more!
