Welcome to my website!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Guest Group](http://engineeringforsustainability.com) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](http://illinois.edu). I am affiliated with the [Institute of Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE)](https://sustainability.illinois.edu) and the [Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproduct Innovation (CABBI)](https://cabbi.bio) at UIUC. I got my Bachelor degree from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn), my Master from UIUC, and my Doctorate from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu) (with [Prof. Strathmann](https://strathmanngroup.com)).

You can read more about my [research](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/research), check out my [publications](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/publications) and conference [presentations](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/presentations), my experiences in [teaching and mentoring](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/teaching_and_mentoring) (and the education modules I'm developing for quantitative sustainable design (QSD) using the open-source tool developed in my research), as well as some [other activities](https://yalinli2.github.io/webpage/more) (including how this site is built).


My contacts and links to various profiles can be found at the bottom of each page, I'll be excited to get in touch with you!
